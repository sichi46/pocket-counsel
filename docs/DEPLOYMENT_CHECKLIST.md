- [ ] Total documents count: _____ (up to 17 recommended)

## âœ… Step 4: Deployment Execution

- [ ] PowerShell execution policy allows script execution
- [ ] Deployment script run: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/deploy-production.ps1`
- [ ] All deployment steps completed successfully:
  - [ ] Dependencies checked
  - [ ] Environment variables loaded
  - [ ] Storage bucket created (or confirmed existing)
  - [ ] Pinecone setup verified
  - [ ] Dependencies installed
  - [ ] Application built
  - [ ] Firebase deployment completed
  - [ ] Documents uploaded to storage

## âœ… Step 5: Verification

### Firebase Functions
- [ ] Functions deployed successfully
- [ ] No deployment errors in Firebase console
- [ ] Function logs accessible

### Storage
- [ ] Documents uploaded to Google Cloud Storage
- [ ] Bucket accessible and contains uploaded files
- [ ] File permissions set correctly

### Pinecone
- [ ] Index accessible via API
- [ ] No connection errors
- [ ] Index ready for vector storage

## âœ… Step 6: Testing

### First Query Test
- [ ] Made first query to trigger document processing
- [ ] Processing started (check Firebase logs)
- [ ] No errors during processing
- [ ] Processing completed successfully

### System Verification
- [ ] RAG system responds to queries
- [ ] Answers include source citations
- [ ] Vector search working correctly
- [ ] Embeddings created successfully

## âœ… Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Logs and Monitoring
- [ ] Firebase Functions logs monitored
- [ ] Pinecone dashboard checked for vector count
- [ ] Google AI API usage monitored
- [ ] No errors in system logs

### Performance
- [ ] Query response times acceptable
- [ ] Document processing completed
- [ ] System handles expected load
- [ ] Memory usage within limits

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Checklist

If deployment fails, check:

### Common Issues
- [ ] API keys are correct and have proper permissions
- [ ] Firebase project exists and is accessible
- [ ] Google Cloud project has billing enabled
- [ ] Pinecone index is in "Ready" state
- [ ] Documents are in correct format and size
- [ ] Network connectivity is stable

### Error Resolution
- [ ] Check Firebase Functions logs for specific errors
- [ ] Verify environment variables are loaded correctly
- [ ] Confirm all dependencies are installed
- [ ] Test API connections individually
- [ ] Review deployment script output for clues
