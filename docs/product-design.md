Epic 1: Onboarding & User Consent
Goal: To onboard users quickly while ensuring they understand and explicitly accept the platform's limitations and purpose.

User Stories:

As a new user, I want to be able to start using the app with minimal friction, either anonymously or by creating a simple account.

As a new user, I want to have to explicitly accept this disclaimer so that I understand the terms of use.

As a new user, I want the option to set my expertise level (e.g., 'General User' or 'Legal Professional/Student') so that answers can be tailored to my needs.

As a new user, I want the option to see a brief tour of what the app can and cannot do, so I can set my expectations correctly.
